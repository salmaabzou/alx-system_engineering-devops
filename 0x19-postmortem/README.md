Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours Start Time: November 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC End Time: November 10, 2023, 18:00 UTC Impact: Service Affected: User Authentication Service User Experience: 70% of users experienced login failures, leading to service unavailability. Timeline:

Detection Time: November 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC

Detection Method: Monitoring alert triggered due to a spike in failed authentication attempts.

Actions Taken:

Investigated Components: Authentication servers, database connections, and load balancers. Assumptions: Initial assumption was a database connection issue due to the high volume of read and write operations during peak hours. Misleading Paths:

Initial Focus: Database connections were initially considered the root cause, leading to intensive scrutiny of database logs and performance metrics. Escalation: Incident escalated to the Database Operations team for further investigation. Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing a bottleneck in handling authentication requests. Resolution Steps: Load balancer settings were adjusted to distribute traffic evenly among authentication servers. Service was gradually restored as the configuration changes propagated. Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Detail: The load balancer misconfiguration caused a delay in processing authentication requests, leading to timeouts and login failures. Resolution Detail: Load balancer settings were modified to ensure proper distribution of incoming requests, resolving the bottleneck issue. Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more robust monitoring for load balancer performance and authentication service response times. Automated Testing: Develop automated tests for load balancer configurations to prevent misconfigurations in the future. Documentation Update: Update documentation to include best practices for load balancer configurations. Tasks to Address the Issue:

Task 1: Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations. Task 2: Implement automated tests for load balancer settings in the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Task 3: Schedule regular load testing to ensure the system can handle peak authentication loads without performance degradation. Task 4: Update incident response procedures to include load balancer issues as a potential cause and the necessary steps for investigation. Task 5: Conduct a training session for the operations team to enhance their skills in identifying and resolving load balancer-related issues. Conclusion: The outage highlighted the critical role of load balancers in ensuring service reliability. Through this incident, we have identified areas for improvement in monitoring, testing, and documentation. The implemented corrective measures aim to prevent similar issues in the future, enhancing the overall stability of our web stack. Ongoing efforts to enhance our systems and processes will remain a top priority to provide a seamless experience for our users.
